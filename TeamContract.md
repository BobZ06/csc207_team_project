# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* **Primary Communication Platform:** WhatsApp will be our main platform for team communication outside of class for coordination on our campus food cart finder app project.

* **Response Time:** Each team member agrees to respond to messages within **24 hours**. For urgent matters, they should be responded within **4 hours**.

* **Notification Requirements:** Team members should notify the group about:
    - Any circumstances that may prevent meeting a deadline (as soon as known)
    - Absences from lectures or labs
    - Technical difficulties or challenges with assigned tasks
    - Changes in availability or schedule conflicts
    - Any concerns about project progress

* **Respectful and Inclusive Communication:** We commit to:
    - Actively listening to each team member's ideas without interruption
    - Giving everyone an equal opportunity to contribute meaningfully
    - Providing constructive feedback rather than criticism
    - Being open-minded to different approaches and perspectives
    - Acknowledging and appreciating each other's contributions

### Work Distribution and Contribution
* **Fair Distribution:** Work will be divided equitably based on each member's strengths, interests, and availability. For our app project, this includes tasks like research on food carts, UI/UX design, development, testing, and documentation.

* **Quality Standards:** All work submitted should be of high quality, properly tested, and follow any agreed-upon coding standards or documentation formats.

* **Regular Updates:** Team members will provide progress updates during meetings and via WhatsApp as needed.

* **Collaboration:** Team members should be willing to help each other when someone is struggling with their assigned tasks.

## Decision Making

* **Decision Process:** Decisions about the project (features to include in the app, technology choices, task assignments, deadlines, etc.) will be made by **majority vote** after open discussion where all perspectives are heard.

* **Major Decisions:** For significant project decisions (such as major pivots in app functionality or technology stack), we will strive for **unanimous agreement** when possible.

* **Tie-Breaking:** In case of a tied vote, we will table the discussion and revisit it at the next meeting after gathering more information or seeking input from the TA.

---
## Conflict resolution

* **Step 1:** Address conflicts directly and respectfully with the involved parties first, using "I" statements to express concerns without blaming.

* **Step 2:** If the conflict cannot be resolved between the involved parties, bring it to the full team for mediation and group discussion.

* **Step 3:** If the team cannot reach a resolution, we will consult with a TA or instructor together to seek guidance.

* **Commitment:** All team members commit to approaching conflicts with an open mind and a willingness to find solutions that work for everyone.

    - Communicating proactively about challenges or delays
    - Attending and participating in team meetings
    - Seeking assistance from teammates, TAs, or instructors when needed
